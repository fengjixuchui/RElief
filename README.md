Scripts used for reverse engineering, malware analysis.

`elfie.py`       - display (basic) info about an ELF, similar to `readelf`.

`elforensics.py` - check ELF for entry point hooks, RWX sections, CTORS & GOT & PLT hooks, function prologue trampolines.

`dololi`         - unfinished, the idea is to automatically generate an executable that calls exports from DLL(s).
